Creating my online portfolio was a good learning experience for me. At first, I had a hard time setting up GitHub because I wasn’t familiar with how repositories work. I made a few mistakes while uploading files and linking them to GitHub Pages, but after checking some tutorials and reviewing the instructions, I managed to fix them. Another challenge was making sure my site looked good on both desktop and mobile. I had to adjust the layout and font sizes to make it more responsive and easier to read.

I also learned how important organization is when building a project. Having a clear folder structure for HTML, CSS, and images helped me manage everything easily. Writing semantic HTML and checking accessibility made me realize that small details, like alt text and contrast, can make a big difference in user experience.

If I were to improve my portfolio, I’d add more animations and better visual design to make it more appealing. I’d also like to include more projects and maybe a contact form to make it easier for people to reach me. Overall, this activity helped me understand both technical and design sides of web development and gave me confidence to create more projects in the future.
